# TEXT SUMMARIZATION TOOL 

## Project Overview

In the current digital era, with so much information available but short attention spans, it is daunting to read long articles or research reports. There has never been a greater need for software that is capable of smartly summarizing large amounts of text into brief overviews. For this increasing demand, I created a **Text Summarization Tool** with Python and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

This project offers a desktop summarizer that converts long content into easily digestible summaries through the power of advanced language models. It is built with a dark UI for a streamlined, clean, and visually attractive user interface. It executes on Python's **Tkinter** for the UI and leverages **Hugging Face Transformers** for the backend summary logic.

## Key Features

- Smart Summarization:-
  Uses pre-trained transformer models to produce human-quality summaries of lengthy text content.

- Word Limit for Custom Summary Length:-  
  The user is allowed to enter a custom word length for summaries using an easy slider.

- Real-Time Word Counter:-
  Keeps the word count in the input space dynamically updated as the user types.

- Clear All Button:-
  Clears input and output spaces instantly with one tap.

- Threaded Operations:-
  Avoids GUI freezing during summarization by executing threads in the background.

- Darkest Black Theme:-
  design, content and output text areas are rendered with dark deep black colors and bright text to provide high contrast.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.13+**
- **Tkinter** – to create the GUI
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)** – to apply abstractive text summarization
- **Torch** – to enable the transformer models
- **NLTK** – to tokenize and process textual data

## Learning Journey

I utilized **Perplexity AI** as my AI assistant throughout the creation of this tool for idea exploration, debugging, and enhancing my code quality. The site played a crucial role in determining the project's organization and functionalities. Besides, I made heavy use of **GeeksforGeeks** for learning NLP basics and **YouTube** for implementation tutorials and UI design reference.

Development was done in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, providing a seamless coding experience with its Python environment handling, built-in terminal, and support for extensions.

## Practical Applications

- **Journalism** – Summarize news stories in brief.
- **Academics** – Get major points from long research papers or study material.
- **Marketing** – Generate short content teasers from long blogs or reports.
- **Corporate** – summarize internal reports, meeting minutes, and documentation.
- **Learning** – Provide e-learning platforms with summary boxes for faster reading.

## Conclusion

This project shows the practical application of NLP in condensing and enriching information consumption. Through the integration of solid Python libraries and the latest design Styles Knowledge , this summarizer provides a lightweight, high-octane tool for anyone who requires rapid, smart summaries of long documents. As online material continues to grow, applications such as these will become more crucial to simplify our daily information consumption.
